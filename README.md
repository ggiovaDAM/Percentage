# Percentage Guessing Game
This is a web page designed to help improve the user's eye guessing skills, by showing a bar of random size that is randomly filled and user will have to guess. The bar will not be labeled and the user will have to respond with how full they think it is. There is a tolerance value that starts at 10%, that means that the user must be, at max, 10% off of the correct answer. When the user answers correctly the tolerance value will decrease making the user have to guess closer and closer to the correct percentage. The user will gain points per answer that falls inside of the tolerance value, gaining 10 if its perfect.
